# iOS Wallpapers
An archive of every iOS wallpaper officially released by Apple

- [iPhone](#iphone)
- [iPad](#ipad)
- [iPod touch](#ipod-touch)
- [CarPlay](#carplay)

This repository aims to preserve every iOS wallpaper released by Apple, all the way from iPhone OS 1.0 up to (currently) iOS/iPadOS 14.6.
Wallpapers are sorted by device class, followed by the screen size they are made for and the iOS/iPadOS version they have first been introduced in.

If there are multiple screen sizes (such as 3.5" or 6.1"), the screen scale is added to the end. Wallpapers are also split into "Stills" and "Live" (previously "Motion").

All wallpapers are extracted directly from `/Library/Wallpaper` within the respective IPSW files and have not been touched in any way. Thumbnails and `default`/`poster` files have been removed to save space.
